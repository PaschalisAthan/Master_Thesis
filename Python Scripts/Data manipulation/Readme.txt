Data manipulation scripts


balancing_targets.py

While training a model, the content of the training set will affect the ability of the model to predict new examples (test set). For a classifier, the ideal for the training set would be to have equal number of examples for all the labels. This script balances non balanced files.

db_target.py

This script extracts a file for each target containing molecules with information on their binding activity for that target.
